📝FEATURE SELECTION NOTES

Dropped Columns with Reasons:

1. Time — Raw time values (e.g., 17.02.00) are not useful for prediction;
 could be replaced by hour/time-of-day if needed.

2. Vehicle_driver_relation — Mostly repetitive (owner/employee),
 not a strong predictor of severity.

3. Owner_of_vehicle — Similar to driver relation; 
weak impact on accident severity.

4. Casualty_class — Describes the victim, not the driver; 
not available before accident → causes data leakage.

5. Sex_of_casualty — Victim information; irrelevant for prediction,
 could introduce bias.

6. Age_band_of_casualty — Victim info, not available beforehand
 → data leakage.

7. Casualty_severity — Directly related to the target 
→ cannot be used as feature.

8. Work_of_casuality — Post-accident info;
 not predictive.

9. Fitness_of_casuality — Post-accident info;
 not predictive.

10. Number_of_casualties — May correlate too directly with accident severity
 → potential data leakage.

11. Day_of_week — Does not strongly affect accident severity;
 impacts accident count, not injury level.

12. Sex_of_driver — Minimal correlation and could introduce gender bias;
 excluded for fairness.
