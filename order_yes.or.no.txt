"Age_band_of_driver": "Age ranges have a natural progression from younger to older drivers
, which may influence driving behavior and accident risk.",
    "Educational_level": "Education levels are ordered hierarchically
, with higher levels possibly reflecting better awareness or decision-making.",
    "Driving_experience": "Driving experience increases with
 time, and greater experience often correlates with improved driving skills and reduced accident probability.",
    "Service_year_of_vehicle": "The number of service years represents vehicle age,
 where older vehicles are typically more prone to mechanical issues.",
    "Light_conditions": "Lighting quality varies from daylight to complete darkness, 
directly affecting visibility and accident likelihood.",
    "Accident_severity": "Severity of accidents naturally progresses from slight to serious to fatal,
 representing increasing levels of impact and injury."





                         where no order matters
"Type_of_vehicle": "Different vehicle types (e.g., car, lorry, bus) are

    "Area_accident_occured": "Areas like residential, industrial, or rural are distinct 
categories without sequential meaning.",
    "Lanes_or_Medians": "Types of lanes or medians describe road layouts and 
do not imply any order or progression.",
    "Road_allignment": "Road alignment types (e.g., curve, tangent, slope) are 
different geometric forms with no ranking.",
    "Types_of_Junction": "Junction types such as Y-shape or cross are categorical â€” one type 
s not greater or lesser than another.",
    "Road_surface_type": "Surface types like asphalt or earth represent material categories,
 not ordered levels.",
    "Road_surface_conditions": "Conditions such as dry, wet, or muddy describe states,
 not a hierarchy.",
    "Weather_conditions": "Weather types (e.g., normal, rainy, foggy) are categorical
 without any ordinal relationship.",
    "Type_of_collision": "Collision types (e.g., vehicle-vehicle, vehicle-object) are 
distinct event categories, not ordered.",
    "Vehicle_movement": "Movements such as turning, overtaking, or going straight are 
action types without natural order.",
    "Pedestrian_movement": "Pedestrian movements (e.g., crossing, standing) are
 descriptive categories without rank.",
